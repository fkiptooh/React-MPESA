# This a miniproject that integrates Kenyan Safaricom Lipa Na Mpesa API for payment.

This is a MERN Stack project that uses Express and Node for backend and React on the frontend: You should also have ngrok install to set up a callback url so that the payments made by the user are saved back to the local database that is the MongoDb that has been used for this project. The user payment number has been masked just for security reason but you can feel free to unmask them for your own use say when making an order once its integrated on an Ecommerce App.

## How to set up this project.

After you clone or download this project to your local directory, you can run:

## `run npm install`
